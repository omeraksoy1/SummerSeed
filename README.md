# SummerSeed
This repository contains assignments that I completed during my Summer 2021 internship.


### C Project

To run the main program, you need to have the libxml2-dev package installed, and also link it during compliation. The command for my environment was,

'<gcc main-app.c -I/usr/include/libxml2 -lxml2 -o main>'

To run the CLI that interacts with the main program, a simple gcc compilation will suffice.

'<gcc summerseed_cli.c -o cli>'
  
The predefined server path is "/tmp/server".
